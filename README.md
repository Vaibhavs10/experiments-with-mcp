# Experiments with MCP

At this point everyone and their mum's are talking about MCP, this repo is just a collection of experiments with it.

Mostly focused around parctical and applied aspects of MCP than theory/ architecture behind.

## Getting Started

The simplest way is to use a simple client/ library that allows you to get your feet wet as soon as possible.

I'm biased but some of the ways I recommend trying is:

1. `@huggingface/tiny-agents` (for TS fans)
2. `huggingface_hub[mcp]` (for python fans)
